  // 2. Implementing Action Handling
  // -------------------------------

  // Example: Player plays a card from hand onto board (in Planning phase).
  playCard(playerId, cardId) {
    // Verify the current phase is Planning.
    if (this.phase !== GamePhases.PLANNING) {
      return {
        success: false,
        message: "You can only play cards during the Planning phase.",
      }
    }
    const currentPlayerState = this.getCurrentPlayerState()
    if (currentPlayerState.player.id !== playerId) {
      return { success: false, message: "It is not your turn." }
    }
    // Find card in hand.
    const cardIndex = currentPlayerState.hand.findIndex(
      (card) => card._id === cardId
    )
    if (cardIndex === -1) {
      return { success: false, message: "Card not found in your hand." }
    }
    const card = currentPlayerState.hand.splice(cardIndex, 1)[0]
    // Rule enforcement could be added here (e.g., can only play cards with sufficient mana, etc.)
    currentPlayerState.board.push(card)
    this.notifyPlayers(`${currentPlayerState.player.name} played ${card.name}.`)
    return { success: true, card }
  }

  // Example: Combat resolution - a simplified method.
  resolveCombat() {
    // In a full system, you would compare board cards and calculate damage, etc.
    // For now, simply log a message.
    this.notifyPlayers(
      `Combat resolved for ${this.getCurrentPlayer().name}'s turn.`
    )
    // After combat, move to END phase.
    this.phase = GamePhases.END
    this.notifyPlayers(`Entering ${this.phase} phase.`)
  }

  // A method to process generic player actions.
  processAction(actionData) {
    // actionData could be an object with { playerId, type, cardId, ... }
    // Example structure:
    // { playerId: "p1", type: "playCard", cardId: "card123" }
    let result
    switch (actionData.type) {
      case "playCard":
        result = this.playCard(actionData.playerId, actionData.cardId)
        break
      case "endPhase":
        this.nextPhase()
        result = { success: true }
        break
      case "resolveCombat":
        this.resolveCombat()
        result = { success: true }
        break
      // Additional actions can be handled.
      default:
        result = { success: false, message: "Unknown action type." }
        break
    }
    return result
  }

  // -------------------------------
  // 3. Notify Players (for real-time updates)
  // -------------------------------

  // This function would ideally use Socket.IO to send updates. For now, we simply log.
  notifyPlayers(message) {
    // In your Socket.IO integration, you would do:
    // io.to(this.roomId).emit('gameUpdate', { phase: this.phase, message, currentPlayer: this.getCurrentPlayer().name });
    console.log(`[Game Update][Room ${this.roomId}]: ${message}`)
  }
}
